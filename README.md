All algorithms implemented as explained in the python notebook that is in the project description. We used external library XChart in our visualization. Below you can see the charts and time and results of algorithms.

Here is our gitHub link below.

## Greedy Algorithm

**public static int getMinValue()**:  It finds the closest cities and sorts them from the shortest distance to the longest.  
**public void setSegments():** It assigns the elements in segments. 
**private void sortEdges():** Sorts the edges  
**private void createCircle():** Creates circular links between cities 
**private void selectEdge() :** It controls the endpoints and turns the segments in reverse if it is needed, in order to link segments with others.
**public static int[] getEdge():** It takes the distances between cities and chooses cities with the shortest distances. And it returns these closest cities.
